## Identifying scale-emergent, nonlinear, asynchronous processes of wetland methane exchange

[@sturtevant2016]

Research Gaps:

-   Most challenging aspect of understanding ecosystem functioning is accounting for overlapping, asynchronous, nonlinear processes

-   Our ability to adequately model whole-ecosystem wetland methane emission is rudimentary [@bridgham2013], in part due to poorly resolved dynamics over a wide range of conditions at the whole-ecosystem level

-   Traditional statistical analysis often ignores scale and assumes linearity and synchronicity, limits the characterization of important dynamics

-   Combining wavelets and information theory to understand multiscale eco-atmosphere interactions is rare, only been applied to terrestrial upland sites

Objectives:

-   Research question: What do we miss by assuming linearity and/or synchronicity and ignoring scale-specific interactions?

-   1\) the dominant biosphere-atmosphere flux processes and time scales they act at; 2) their nonlinear and asynchronous characteristics and 3) how they contributed to the strength and timing of biosphere-atmosphere exchange.

The source's strengths and weaknesses:

Conclusions:

An evaluation of the research methodology:

1\) Wavelet Analysis

-   Wavelet decomposition characterizes both time scale and location of patterns and perturbations in the data

-   Maximal-overlap discrete wavelet transform [@percival1995],

2\) Information Theory

-   Mutual information [@fraser1986], I, describes the average tendency for paired states of two variables (X and Y) to coexist

-   Relative mutual information, Ir_xy = Ixy/Hy, represents the proportion of bits needed to represent Y that are superfluous given the knowledge of X (It's a normalized measure of statistical dependence of Y on X, higher values indicating greater dependence); the power of Ixy in the lack of parametric assumptions about the relationship between X and Y, thus able to identify linear and nonlinear interactions alike. By further adding temporal directionality in Ixy. torque = 0, "synchronous" interaction, variations in Y have the strongest dependence on concurrent variations in X; torque \< 0, variations in Y lead variations in X; torque \> 0, variations in Y lag variations in X;

Takeaways:

-   Methane emission in response to water table fluctuation can be nonlinear and lagged up to 10 days [@moore1993]

## Heatwave effects on gross primary production of northern mid-latitude ecosystems

[@xu2020a; @xu2020]

Paper Type: Research data based (by using FLUXNET Tier-1 sites data)

Study sites: FLUXNET2015 Tier-1 sites

Statistical Analysis: Path Analysis (https://www.ibm.com/products/structural-equation-modeling-sem)

-   3 environmental variables, including sw radiation, Ta and ESI that can affect GPP directly; Ta/VPD/ESI and Rg may indirectly affect GPP by regulating Gc; biological element is closely related to GPP by directly regulating intracellular CO2; and Ta is linked with atmospheric transpiration demand (VPD) and ecosystem soil water condition (ESI)

Takeaways:

-   Impacts of heatwaves on ecosystem GPP varied by ecosystem type and plant functional type; GPP was depressed for most ecosystems during heatwaves while it was enhanced for C4 ecosystems

-   ESI was the primary variable for the discrepancy in GPP anomaly during heatwaves across the nine ecosystems

-   Decline in forest GPP induced by heatwaves was smaller than other ecosystems

Key Knowledge Points:

1\) C3/C4 ecosystems:

-   C3 Plants

    -   carbon fixation is the most common, which incorporate CO2 + RuBisCo -\> 3-phosphoglycerate

    -   All occured in mesophyll

    -   C3 Plants unfortunately have no special adaptations to avoid photorespiration; if the temperature rises above the ideal range (20-30 celsius degrees), C3 plants' photosynthesis rate falls dramatically.

-   C4 Plants

    -   close stomata to contain water loss; to avoid photo-respiration, CO2+PEP carboxylase -\> Oxaloacetate (4C) located in mesophyll cell, calvin cylcle occured in bundle sheath

    -   3% of land plants use this, ideal under 30-40 celsius degree

2\) Canopy conductance (Gc, canopy integrated stomatal conductance, mm/s):

-   a measure of water vapour transfer from the plant to the atmosphere. Conductance is the ease with which water can transfer from the plant to the atmosphere with higher values indicating easier transfer.

-   Aerodynamic conductance (mm/s), the ease with which air can move through a boundary layer,

3\) Evaporative Stress Index (ESI), representing standardized anomalies in the ratio of actual evapotranspiration (ET) to potential evapotranspiration (PET), has been extensively used to measure the degree of soil water stress for plants/ecosystems & minimize the impacts of non-moisture-related environmental drivers (eg. radiation and atmospheric demand) on ecosystem functions.

-   Negative ESI values -\> soil water supply is not sustained for ecosystem health

-   ET/PET; ET = latent heat flux (LE)/latent heat of vaporization (\~2.5 MJ/kg)

-   PET

-   ESI (timestep=w, year=y) = (V(w,y)-1/ny\*sum of V(w,y))/(standard deviation of V)

    -   V(w,y) -\> ratio of actual ET to potential ET for a given timestep (W) and year (y)

## Methane Emissions from Subtropical Wetlands: An Evaluation of the role of data filtering on annual methane budgets

[@staudhammer2022]

Paper Type: Theory,

Knowledge gaps:

-   CH~4~ fluxes, their range and controls are to a large extent not currently well understood, and thus robust methods for filtering and gap-filling data are generally lacking

-   many of these studies lack full-year temporal coverage, hinders our ability to develop annual methane budgets with confidence.

Objectives:

-   study the effects that data filtering has on gap-filled CH~4~ in these systems.

-   provide insight on how gaps in predictor variables for gap-filling models ---both their size and timing--- may affect the procedures used and subsequent annual budgets derived from CH~4~ data.

    -   compare between "unrestricted predictors model" (using all possible predictors regardless of gaps), versus a "restricted predictors model" (using gap-filled predictors or predictors with no missing values)

Key Knowledge Points:

-   Missing half hourly F~CO2~ data were gap filled using separate functions for day and night. When PAR was \>10 µmol m^−2^ s^−1^, F~CO2~ data were gap-filled using a Michaelis-Menten approach, and when PAR was ≤10 µmol m^−2^ s^−1^, F~CO2~ data were gap-filled using an Arrhenius approach.

## Seasonal Patterns and Controls on Net Ecosystem CO2 Exchange in a Boreal Peatland Complex

Study Sites: Northern study area of boreal ecosystems atmosphere study (BOREAS)

Measurement method:

-   Clear chamber -\> NEE; Chamber, shrouds & different mesh sizes -\> develop relationship between NEE and PAR; CR10 and CR7 loggers -\> WT positions & peat Ts at different depths measured continuously

Takeaways:

-   Daily basis, ER:
    -   soil temperature at 5cm explains 43-74% of the variability in respiration
    -   Water table explains an additional 5-20% for ER
-   Seasonal basis:
    -   average seasonal dark CO2 flux is correlated strongly with average water table position for each collar location (However, the seasonal average water table position is an indication of the depth of the aerobic zone in the peat profile, which explains between-site differences better than average peat temperature)
-   Daily basis, GPP:
    -   PAR is the most important factor, explaining 39-58% of the variation
    -   average temperature & peat temperature: second most important factor, explaining an additional 8-16%
    -   water table position as the 3rd most important variable

## Estimating the carbon fluxes of forests with an individual-based forest model

[@rödig2017]

Paper Type: Model Testing

Objectives: used an individual-based forest gap model (FORMIND) that simulates the growth of individual trees by calculating its photosynthesis and respiration; soil carbon model

-   First, test whether the local forest model is generally capable of displaying daily carbon fluxes.

-   Second, analyzed whether the model processes correctly respond to variable climate inputs.

Take-away points:

Second, we analyzed whether the model processes correctly respond to variable climate inputs

Introduction:

-   correctly capturing the responses of an ecosystem to varying climatic conditions with vegetation models is a major challenge (Keenan et al. 2012).

## Terrestrial biosphere model performance for inter-annual variability of land-atmosphere CO2 Exchange

[@keenan2012]

## Europe-wide reduction in primary productivity caused by the heat and drought in 2003

Summary: Europe experienced a heatwave in 2003. Impacts of severe heatwaves on terrestrial carbon cycling is unclear. In this study, 1) used 14 forest sites' eddy data to analyse half-hourly GPP, TER, NEE, to assess the impact of extreme event on carbon balances, 2) used a terrestrial biosphere simulation model to estimate the continental-scale changes in primary productivity in 2003.

Before using the terrestrial biosphere model （ORCHIDEE biosphere model, [@krinner2005a]):

1\) Ran model at each EC site to verify its ability to reproduce the observed GPP and TER anomalies

## Identifying dominant environmental predictors of freshwater wetland methane fluxes across diurnal to seasonal time scales

[@knox2021]

Research Questions:

\(i\) What are the dominant predictors of FCH4 at diurnal to seasonal time scales at each wetland?

\(ii\) How does the relative dominance of each predictor vary across wetland types?

\(iii\) Is the identifi-cation of dominant predictors of FCH4 influenced by the choice of statistical approach?

\(iv\) How important are nonlinearities and lags in interpreting FCH4?

man-ual chamber measurements are typically discrete in time and space, and therefore may not capture the full spatiotemporal range of CH4dynamics, limiting the investigation of the underlying drivers and patterns of FCH4 in wetlands (Morin, 2019).

FLUXNET-CH~4~ SYNTHESIS ACTIVITY: Objectives, Observations, and Future Directions

While most of these sites measure CO2, water vapor, and energy exchange, the development of new and robust CH4 sensors has resulted in a rapidly growing number of CH4 EC measurements (Baldocchi 2014; Morin 2018), 

#### Increasing the number of tropical sites is particularly important for CH4 because more than half of global CH4 emissions are thought to come from this region (Saunois et al. 2016a; Dean et al. 2018).

(Latitudinal data from top-down emissions indicate a predominance of tropical emissions (∼ 64 % of the global budget, \< 30° N) as compared to mid (∼ 32 %, 30--60° N) and high northern latitudes (∼ 4 %, 60--90° N). )

(Of the total wetland CH~4~ emissions, tropical wetlands account for 50--60%, northern (Boreal and Arctic) wetlands \~34%, and temperate wetlands \~5% (Bloom et al., [2010](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017RG000559#rog20161-bib-0036); Wanget al., [1996](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017RG000559#rog20161-bib-0436)).)
