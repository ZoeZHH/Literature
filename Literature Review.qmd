## Identifying scale-emergent, nonlinear, asynchronous processes of wetland methane exchange

[@sturtevant2016]

Research Gaps:

-   Most challenging aspect of understanding ecosystem functioning is accounting for overlapping, asynchronous, nonlinear processes

-   Our ability to adequately model whole-ecosystem wetland methane emission is rudimentary [@bridgham2013], in part due to poorly resolved dynamics over a wide range of conditions at the whole-ecosystem level

-   Traditional statistical analysis often ignores scale and assumes linearity and synchronicity, limits the characterization of important dynamics

-   Combining wavelets and information theory to understand multiscale eco-atmosphere interactions is rare, only been applied to terrestrial upland sites

Objectives:

-   Research question: What do we miss by assuming linearity and/or synchronicity and ignoring scale-specific interactions?

-   1\) the dominant biosphere-atmosphere flux processes and time scales they act at; 2) their nonlinear and asynchronous characteristics and 3) how they contributed to the strength and timing of biosphere-atmosphere exchange.

The source's strengths and weaknesses:

Conclusions:

An evaluation of the research methodology:

1\) Wavelet Analysis

-   Wavelet decomposition characterizes both time scale and location of patterns and perturbations in the data

-   Maximal-overlap discrete wavelet transform [@percival1995],

2\) Information Theory

-   Mutual information [@fraser1986], I, describes the average tendency for paired states of two variables (X and Y) to coexist

-   Relative mutual information, Ir_xy = Ixy/Hy, represents the proportion of bits needed to represent Y that are superfluous given the knowledge of X (It's a normalized measure of statistical dependence of Y on X, higher values indicating greater dependence); the power of Ixy in the lack of parametric assumptions about the relationship between X and Y, thus able to identify linear and nonlinear interactions alike. By further adding temporal directionality in Ixy. torque = 0, "synchronous" interaction, variations in Y have the strongest dependence on concurrent variations in X; torque \< 0, variations in Y lead variations in X; torque \> 0, variations in Y lag variations in X;

Takeaways:

-   Methane emission in response to water table fluctuation can be nonlinear and lagged up to 10 days [@moore1993]
